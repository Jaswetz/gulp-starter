## Intro
I build beautiful & usable web and mobile products.
## About
### A kid playing with his Legos, that's how I feel.
I'm Jason and I've got a passion for creating. I enjoy the process as much as I do the final product. I believe in iteration and communication. I'm self-taught and never stop learning. My goal is to meet awesome people, create excellent things, and continue growing.

### Design
I design aesthetically pleasing, readable, browsable, and responsive content. I like to use an iterative process, I start fantastical and then strip the design down to only the optimal.

### Front-End
I build accessible interactive content that solves problems. I keep code semantic and optimized by following best practices.

### User Experience
I strive to create a better relationship between humans and technology by creating an intuitive experience. My goal is not to dazzle or force the user but allow the user to follow their own flow.

## Work
### Househappy Web App
As a UX Designer at Househappy I worked on different features, including a full redesign and rewrite of styles, making the design and code more modular. I also help design and develop new features.

### Househappy iOS App
As a UX designer at Househappy I am responsible for user experience, prototyping, and designing on both Househappy's iPhone and iPad app.

### Jerhel Redesign
I was hired to redesign Jerhel's website. The goal was to make all interactions more user-friendly and make the website usable on all devices.

## Portfolio Site v1
This was the first version of this website. My goal was not only to build a portfolio website to showcase my skills but also to have a place to experiment with new tools and ideas.
